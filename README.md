   Answer:
I. Download the installer from the official Visual Studio Code website. Make sure to choose the
version compatible with Windows 11.
II. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. By
default, VS Code will be installed in the usual location for programs on your system. You can
choose to change the installation directory if needed.
III. After the installation is complete, VS Code will launch automatically. You can now start using
it for your coding projects!

II. Python
III. Jinja


3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
Answer:
The Visual Studio Code interface is designed to provide a clear and efficient workspace for
developers with the following components
I. Activity Bar: Located on the far left, the Activity Bar provides quick access to different
views in VS Code, such as the Explorer (file management), Git (version control), Debug
(debugging tools), and Extensions.
II. Side Bar: The Side Bar can host different panels that complement your editing
experience.
III. Editor: This is the central area where you write and edit your code. You can open
multiple files and arrange them in tabs or split them side-by-side for efficient code
comparison or reference.
IV. Status Bar: Located at the bottom, the Status Bar displays information about the current
file, like its language, encoding, and line and column position of your cursor. It can also
house indicators for Git status and extension activity.

The Command Palette can be access using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P
(Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
The Command Palette offers a quick and efficient way to perform a wide range of tasks in VS
Code, without navigating through menus. Here are some examples of what you can do with it:
I. Open files or folders within your project.
II. Search for symbols or functions across your codebase.
III. Run code formatting or linting tasks.
IV. Install or manage extensions.
V. Access integrated Git commands for version control.
VI. Open VS Code settings to customize the editor's behavior.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
   Answer:
Finding, installing, and managing extensions in VS Code is straightforward. You can find the
extension in the left pane / activity bar, the extension can be installed there and managed.
Examples include
I. Language extensions: Add syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and other language-specific
features for languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
II. Linters and formatters: ESLint or JSHint help catch errors and enforce style guides, while
Prettier or Beautify automatically format your code for consistency.
III. Debuggers: Extensions like Debugger for Chrome or Firefox allow you to debug your
web applications directly within VS Code.
IV. Git extensions: GitLens simplifies working with Git repositories by providing a visual
representation of your code history and making Git commands more accessible

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
   Answer:
The integrated terminal in VS Code provides a convenient way to execute command-line tools
and interact with your operating system directly within the VS Code environment. Here's how to
open and use it:
● Open the terminal: There are several ways to access the integrated terminal:
● Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+ (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+ (Mac).
● Go to the Terminal menu and select New Terminal.
● Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and search for "Terminal: New
Terminal".
The integrated terminal functions like a regular terminal window. You can type your commands
and press Enter to execute them. The terminal also provides features like a history of past
commands and the ability to copy and paste text.
Advantages of using the integrated terminal:
I. Convenience: Quickly switch between code editing and terminal commands without
needing to open a separate terminal window.
II. Integration: The terminal can leverage VS Code features like working directory detection
and automatic path completion for improved efficiency.
III. Customization: You can customize the terminal's appearance, font size, and behavior to
match your preferences.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?Answer:
VS Code provides a user-friendly interface for creating, opening, and managing files and
folders. Here's a quick guide:
Creating and Opening Files and Folders:
● New File: Use the File menu option or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd + N) to create a new
file.
● New Folder: Right-click in the Explorer view and select "New Folder" to create a new
folder.
● Open Folder: Use the File menu option (Open Folder) or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd +
K) to open an existing folder in your workspace.
Managing Files and Folders:
● Explorer View: The Explorer view on the left side of VS Code lets you browse, open, and
manage files and folders within your project.
● Context Menu: Right-click on any file or folder to access various options for renaming,
deleting, copying, cutting, and pasting.
● Drag and Drop: Drag and drop files or folders to move or copy them within the
workspace.
Navigating Efficiently:
● Go to File: Use the "Go to File" feature (Ctrl/Cmd + P) to quickly open any file by
searching its name.
● Open Recent: Access the "File" menu to view and reopen recently opened files.
● Split View: Use split view mode to view and edit multiple files simultaneously.
● Keyboard Shortcuts: Utilize keyboard shortcuts for common actions like saving, copying,
pasting, and navigation to streamline your workflow.

   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
   Answer:
Setting up and Debugging a Simple Program in VS Code:
● Create a launch.json file: This file configures the debugger for your specific programming
language. VS Code can often generate a basic launch.json file for common languages.
● Set breakpoints: Place breakpoints in your code to pause execution at specific lines.
This allows you to examine variable values and program flow.
● Start debugging: Use the Run and Debug view (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D) to initiate
debugging. VS Code will launch your program and pause at the first breakpoint.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code:
● Stepping: Step through your code line by line to inspect variable values and execution
flow.
● Breakpoints: Set, manage, and conditional breakpoints to control the debugging
process.
● Call Stack: View the call stack to trace function calls and identify potential issues.
● Variables: Examine the values of variables at different points in your code.
● Expressions: Evaluate expressions within the debugger to inspect their values on the fly.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
    Answer:
Integrating Git with VS Code for version control streamlines your workflow, ensure you have Git
installed on your system, Here's a simplified breakdown:
Initializing a Repository:
● Open your project folder in VS Code.
● Look for the Source Control view in the Activity bar (left side by default). If not visible,
you can enable it from the View menu.
● Click on the "+" icon in the Source Control view and select "Initialize Repository". This
creates a new Git repository in your project folder.
Making Commits:
● Stage changes you want to include in your commit using the Source Control view or the
inline staging icons next to modified files.
● Open the Source Control view and type a descriptive commit message.
● Click on the commit button (checkmark icon) to create a commit with your staged
changes and message.
Pushing to GitHub:
● Create a remote repository on GitHub for your project (if you don't have one already).
● In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P).
● Search for "Git: Push" and select the appropriate option to push your local commits to
the remote repository on GitHub
